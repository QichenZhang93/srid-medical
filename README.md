The interface is very easy-to-use and intuitive. Just follow the text and buttons and you can figure out how to use it.

## Limitations

This is a high-fideligy prototype and we have not completed all functions.

The pending functions are:

1. Integrate our app with existing hospital appointment system to provide seamless experience.
2. Allow users to import previous medical history from other sources. This requires APIs from other hospital system. (DONE but need to elaborate)
3. Auto-analysis patient's input (treatment, diagnosis, 'Note' in the appointment page, etc.) and convert them to the version that is more informational and easier to read.
